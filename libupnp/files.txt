This folder should contain the dll files for the UPnP library. These should be;
 - libupnp.dll
 - pthreadVC2.dll
and they should be loacted in their respective "Release" and "Debug" subfolders.

the post build event 'install.bat' will copy them to the lua directory.

If a static build is done, then they won't be required as they will be linked in the LuaUPnP.dll

Both dll files should be build using their own projects, but with the same runtime 
dependency, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235460%28v=VS.100%29.aspx
